    "This is a determinist approch to the problem. Our solution combines 4 key elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Memory mapping: Each agent builds its own map of the environment as it explores\n",
    "* Collaborative intelligence: Agents share their observations within communication range (ONLY intant t information and ONLY when they are in range)\n",
    "* A pathfinding:* A classic search algorithm that guarantees optimal paths\n",
    "* Fallback strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**MAPPING**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent maintains its own memory map of the environment, which starts mostly unknown (-1) and gets updated as the agent explores:\n",
    "\n",
    "* -1: Unknown areas\n",
    "* 0: Free space\n",
    "* 1: Walls\n",
    "* 2: Dynamic obstacles\n",
    "* 3: Other agents\n",
    "* 4: Goal location\n",
    "\n",
    "The agents progressively build this map through:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Their own LIDAR observations\n",
    "* Information shared by other agents within communication range\n",
    "\n",
    "The system tracks \"danger zones\" around dynamic obstacles: When a dynamic obstacle is detected, the surrounding cells are marked as dangerous. The pathfinding algorithms avoid these danger zones when possible. This creates a safety buffer around moving obstacles\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is (A-Star)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A* is like a smart GPS for grid environments. Here's how it works in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Imagine you're in a maze trying to find the exit\n",
    "* At each intersection, A* evaluates all possible paths based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * How far you've already traveled from your starting point\n",
    "    * How far you estimate you are from the goal using manhanthan distance \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A* always explores the most promising path first\n",
    "* It maintains a list of intersections to visit, always prioritizing the most promising one\n",
    "* Once the goal is reached, it traces back the optimal path\n",
    "\n",
    "A* make sure to find the shortest possible path when one exists (in general it is more perfoment than other approch such as breadth-first search).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the standard A* can't find a path (due to unknown areas or obstacles), we implemented 2 fallback strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a_star_allow_unknown: A modified A* that applies penalties to unknown or dangerous cells rather than avoiding them completely\n",
    "* greedy_path: A simple greedy approach that always moves toward the goal, used as a last resort\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, several mechanisms prevent agents from getting stuck:\n",
    "\n",
    "stuck_counter: Tracks how long an agent stays in the same position\n",
    "action_repeat_counter: Tracks how many times the same action is repeated\n",
    "Random actions are taken if stagnation is detected\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process :**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each step, the agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Updates its memory based on current observations and shared information\n",
    "2. Checks if it has reached the goal\n",
    "3. Calculates a path to the goal using A* (with fallbacks)\n",
    "4. Determines the next action based on:\n",
    "    * The next position in the calculated path\n",
    "    * The current orientation (may need to rotate first)\n",
    "5. Applies anti-stagnation checks to avoid getting stuck\n",
